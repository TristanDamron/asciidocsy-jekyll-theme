// tag::overview[]
// tag::opener[]
AsciiDocsy is an Asciidoctor-ready *Jekyll theme for technical documentation*, adaptable to pretty much any Jekyll application.
// end::opener[]

This is a major fork of the awesome link:https://github.com/vsoch/docsy-jekyll[Docsy Jekyll port] done by link:{forked_source_www}[VanessaSaurus], itself a fork of Google's link://www.docsy.dev[Docsy theme for Hugo].
The last commit from the Docsy Jekyll version was retained for convenient diffing and just to maintain full credit.

== Purpose
// tag::purpose[]
AsciiDocsy is designed by a technical documentation specialist who builds bespoke AsciiDoc platforms for world-class enterprises.

[.case]*_On the front end_*, AsciiDocsy [.buz]_delivers_.
Designed to meet the technical documentation deployment needs of full-scale, multi-product software companies, AsciiDocsy remains fully aware that all such enterprises start small and still need world-class docs.

[.case]*_On the back end_*, AsciiDocsy [.buz]_unifies_.
The codebase brings together developers and technical writers, allowing the latter to achieve momentous feats in collaboration with the developers whose work they document.
// end::purpose[]

== Pre-1.0 History and Roadmap

AsciiDocsy will probably reach "`general availability`"/v1.0 (GA) status sometime after v0.4.0 is out, which will hopefully be late 2021.
Until that point, backward compatibility is not guaranteed, but AsciiDocsy will try to make no breaking changes between major releases starting at v1.0.

=== 1.0 Objectives

The following are areas where AsciiDocsy's author thinks good GA-ready software meets a high standard but that AsciiDocsy presently does not yet measure up.

extreme configurability::
There should never be a need to modify template files just to make minor changes.
Everything should be defined in data files.
The system is in place for this as of v0.2.0, but lots of settings and strings need to be moved into these files.

front-end quality::
The jQuery/JavaScript I write is fairly rudimentary.
Fortunately, the challenges are also pretty straightforward, but it will still be best if a JS specialist goes over the code and maybe writes some tests.
Another challenge is to make sure all HTML link:https://github.com/DocOps/asciidocsy-jekyll-theme/issues/69[meets accessibility standards].

back-end quality::
Dependency management for the entire LiquiDoc Ops toolchain must be sensible and seamless.
Vendor code must be separately manageable, including as independently maintained forks.

clean, well-documented source::
Mainly thinking of YAML and Liquid code here, lots of these source files need proper headers and style review.

// end::overview[]

== Usage

Out of the box, this theme is ready for a somewhat plainly structured Jekyll application, with AsciiDoc support and tons of additional features.

AsciiDocsy has hooks and features specifically designed to take advantage of such applications when built using the LiquiDoc Ops framework, but it should be handy for any Jekyll site, AsciiDoc-based or not.

[CAUTION]
If you intend to use AsciiDocsy for *Markdown* in addition to or rather than AsciiDoc content source, at this time you will need to undo some of the configuration changes made for this demo repo.
Between your existing configuration file and link:{forked_source_www}[VanessaSaurus's Docsy Jekyll theme source and docs], you should be able to adapt this codebase to render `.md` files of your flavor.

Documentation for this theme can be found at link:{theme_docs_www}[].

Alternatively, <<build-the-docs,build your own locally>>.

== Quickstart

Assuming you have a <<requirements,proper Ruby runtime>> environment installed, all you need to do is install dependencies and run the Jekyll command.

=== Requirements
// tag::requirements-ruby[]
Other than a Ruby runtime environment, this codebase installs all dependencies using Bundler.

[TIP]
Check for a current Ruby version using `ruby -v`.

*If you do not have Ruby installed*, use link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides[Jekyll's installation instructions].

[.os-win]
[TIP]
*Windows 10 users* are strongly encouraged to link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[use this guide to running Jekyll on Linux via WSL].

[.os-mac.os-nix]
[TIP]
MacOS and Linux users are encouraged to install and manage Ruby using link:https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[rbenv].

[NOTE]
All else being equal, we recommend you install the latest stable release, so Ruby 2.7.x or 3.0.x (where `x` is the latest patch version).
Jekyll 4.0.0 and the jekyll-asciidoc plugin both require Ruby 2.4.0 or later.

// end::requirements-ruby[]

[[build-the-docs]]
=== Build the Docs
// tag::quickstart-build[]
With a Ruby environment in place, these steps should generate the website sourced in the AsciiDocsy theme repository.

. Clone (or download and inflate) this repo.
+
.Clone
[subs=+attributes]
 git clone {theme_repo_git}
+
.Download & inflate
--
image::github-repo-download_screenshot.png[GitHub repository download button]
--
+
[TIP]
Use [.cmd]`git clone {theme_repo_git} my-asciidocsy-project` to name the containing directory something other than `asciidocsy`.
Or clone normally and freely rename the directory at any time.

. Install Ruby dependencies.
+
 bundle install
+
If Bundler is not installed, [.cmd]`gem install bundler`, then repeat [.cmd]`bundle install`.

. Change to the new directory.
+
.Example
 cd my-asciidocsy-project

. Generate and serve the demo site.
+
 bundle exec jekyll serve

You should now be able to view the site at `http://localhost:4000` in any local browser.

You will find the generated files at `_site/`.
// end::quickstart-build[]

[TIP]
Learn more about applying AsciiDocsy to your use case in the link:{theme_docs-bootstrapping_www}[Bootstrapping guide].

== Production Environment Details

The demo/docs site included in this repository generates a site at {theme_demo_www}.
This site is deployed

=== Deploying

The site automatically generates and deploys each time a commit is merged to the `main` branch.

=== Search Indexing

The search indexing procedure is manual at this time, though we will move it to a GitHub Action before long.

There are two indexes: `asciidocsy-pages` and `asciidocsy-topics`.
Each has its own custom configuration in `_docs/_data/configs/`.

You must have the Admin-only private key to write files to the Algolia index.
See link:{theme_demo_www}/docs/theme/config/search/algolia#index-settings[Algolia Search Config: Index Settings] for specifics.

The indices must be processed separately.
Here are the commands:

.Site search
 bundle exec jekyll algolia --config _config.yml,_docs/_data/configs/search-index-pages.yml

.Subject search
 bundle exec jekyll algolia --config _config.yml,_docs/_data/configs/search-index-topics.yml

== Contributing

AsciiDocsy is open for contributions.
I plan for it to be a primary project with regular, ongoing maintenance, as I expect to use it for multiple clients over the next 5-15 years.

I will work up contributor guidelines and PR templates well before v1.0.
Please standby.

Please don't hesitate to create an issue or or pull request in the meantime!

=== Contribution Notes

Since I've received a couple of small pull requests from folks, I should probably track my conventions and process here to minimize frustration.

Right now I am developing on trunk branches just so I can keep releases straight.
I will find a better way to do this, but for now I am trunking for each upcoming minor release.
So it's `trunk-0.2.0`, `trunk-0.3.0`, etc.
These branch off `main`, and PRs can be merged to the `trunk-` branches, unless they are patches, which can be merged to `main` and then rebased to `trunk-`.

Since this is complicated and potentially disruptive, most patches will await a minor release.
Therefore, they can be branched from and merged to the current `trunk-` branch.

== Licensing

All sources of copyrighted material incorporated into this theme are duly licensed and attributed, falling under MIT or Apache 2.0 permissive licenses.
Most cases of third-party source code showing up in this codebase will be transitioned by release 1.0 vendor code as dependencies to be hosted elsewhere.

An *exception* to individually attributed code snippets is the *Docsy Jekyll* theme by link:https://vsoch.github.io[*VanessaSaurus*].
I left a copyright notice in the templates for now, but will happily negotiate attribution while this project is in pre-release status.
Much of the code in the `_includes/` and `_layouts/` directories remains from the original.

[NOTE]
While this project is not an active fork of Docsy Jekyll, it was forked at commit # link:{theme_repo_www}/tree/b5f32a12c6358b18d716755b6605ef9ed0bb2526[b5f32a1], if you want to run a diff.

The remainder of the code is released under *both MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses*.
Basically, if you fork this codebase, know that it comes without warranty, and please leave a trail back to those whose work you're building on if you release something that contains our code.

The other *exception* is Navgoco, the jQuery menu generator, which is licensed under the BSD-3-clause license.
The Navgoco project has been dormant for years, so we will swap this navigation out for something equivalent.

See the `.data/dependencies.yml` file in this repository for a listing of third-party code.

All other dependencies are Ruby gems.
See `Gemfile.lock` for all versions of all Bundler-managed dependencies.
