= AsciiDocsy Theme Documentation

This directory (`_docs/`) contains documentation content _about the AsciiDocsy theme_.
You are welcome to use it as a starting point to internally document your own implementation of AsciiDocsy, but be sure to update or remove this README if you do.

This path also constitutes the main content source for the AsciiDocsy demo site, as configured by files in the project root directory, such as `_config.yml`.

The contents of this docset are mainly (1) a user guide for the theme and (2) a style guide for each markup format (AsciiDoc, YAML, and Liquid) that constitute the documentation languages.

If you are using AsciiDocsy for a documentation project, you might keep this content as part of your documentation platform, as each new release will be the canonical reference for AsciiDocsy theme.

== Build

To build the docs, use the quickstart/demo instructions in the link:../README.adoc[root README file].
