        summ: Added ReleaseHx "`release history`" templates
        note: |
          AsciiDocsy provides a templates and a YAML format for generating release notes and/or a changelog.
          If you are reading this as HTML or PDF, you are most likely looking at one such generated release history, for AsciiDocsy itself.
          Documentation is forthcoming; this feature may change without notice prior to 1.0.
