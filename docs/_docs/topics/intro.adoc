= AsciiDocsy Documentation

This website serves two roles.
It both _exemplifies_ and _documents_ the AsciiDocsy theme for Jekyll.

The AsciiDocsy documentation is broken into two domains.

The link:/docs/theme[AsciiDocsy Theme Docs] instruct working with this particular codebase.
These topics are pretty essential to getting AsciiDocsy working.

Much more optional is the link:/docs/style[Docs-as-Code Style Guide], presently covering link:/docs/style/asciidoc[AsciiDoc] content markup, link:/docs/style/yaml/[YAML] data markup, and link:/docs/style/liquid[Liquid] templating markup.
These guides may get a canonical home elsewhere, but for now I'm sourcing it right in this repo.
