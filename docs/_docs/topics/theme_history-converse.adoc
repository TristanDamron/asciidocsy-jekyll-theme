====
This is an *alternate version* of the AsciiDocsy Release History, generated by <</docs/theme/config/release-hx#,ReleaseHX>>, a component of AsciiDocsy.
ReleaseHX is fully open source, and you are welcome to use it in your project.

This page is to demonstrate the transformational power of ReleaseHX, but in our case it is not an optimal arrangement for reviewing the actual release history of AsciiDocsy.
