[NOTE]
This page was generated by <</docs/theme/config/release-hx#,ReleaseHX>>, a component of AsciiDocsy.
ReleaseHX is fully open source, and you are welcome to use it in your project.

This page tells the story of AsciiDocsy.
This system for Release Notes and Changelog is itself novel and experimental.
It is intended for collaborative team implementation at scale, which we try to demonstrate here as we scale up to the complexity of the v1.0 release.

Try some alternative versions of this page:

* <</docs/theme/history-converse#,Changelog sorted by part; notes sorted by type>>
* <</docs/theme/history-patches-merged#,Patch versions merged with next major/minor docs>>
